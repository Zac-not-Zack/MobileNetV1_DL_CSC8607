# 🤖 Projet DL : Building MobileNet V1 from scratch 📇

Contributor : WONG Hoe Ziet (TSP MAIA 2025 🐝)

Reference : https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861

# 🔡 Dataset
ImageNet 

# 🎯 Objective 
Recreate the MobileNet V1 model which is based on Depthwise convolution from scratch, guided by the article published in 2017 by using only knowledge gained from DL course at TSP

# 💻 Deep Learning
The DL library used : PyTorch

Optimizer : RMSProp

LR Decay : Polynomial Decay

Loss function : Cross Entropy

To visualize training results on Tensorboard : tensorboard --logdir=runs_mobnet2 --host=0.0.0.0 --port=6006
